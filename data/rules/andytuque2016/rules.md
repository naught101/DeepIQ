---------------------------

Basically the gist of it is you have a bunch of tables and a d10. For Deep IQ's turn, you roll the die and do whatever it says on the table. You also need to check to see if Deep IQ advanced to the next table (imagine higher tables equals more mana). As you roll, you want to play Deep IQ as if it's trying to win, so do the worst thing for yourself.

Since you're playing against an opponent that doesn't have a deck and can't play instants, you need to get a little creative for some mechanics. For example, instead of milling Deep IQ for 3 cards, maybe it gets -2 on its next die roll. Or if you want to ingest/process, keep an ingest counter so you know how many "cards" are in exile.

The tables that are listed on the website are a little outdated and more recent cards destroy Deep IQ most games. And that's not the most fun thing to play against. So I have been trying to update the tables to give it a more level playing field. I've played a few games with these tables and I've had some decent games, both winning and losing.

I tend to play creature heavy decks so when I was updating the tables, I gave Deep IQ a higher percentage chance of playing a creature. I also use a d6 to keep track of what table Deep IQ is on. I would suggest checking the advancement roll first to see if you get to move to the next table, then proceed with whatever you were going to do. I would often forget to advance to the next table. Unless you won't forget.
