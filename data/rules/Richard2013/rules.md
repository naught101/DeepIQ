Deep IQ—2013
------------

Deep IQ starts first. Deep IQ turns go as follows:

- Untap
- Upkeep—Make the die roll and complete the requirements of the die roll. Deep IQ starts on Table I. Note advancements in the table.
- If a token creature is put onto the battlefield, roll to determine the abilities of the creature, adding or subtracting the modifier from the roll.
- Determine if any creatures will be attacking that turn; attack only when it makes sense for Deep IQ to attack.
- End the turn.
