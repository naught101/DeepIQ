Deep IQ
------- 

This variant has you play a game of magic against a series of tables that require 1d10. The order of play for Deep IQ's turn is simple: roll on the current action table, figure out if attacking is good for it, and attack if it's a good idea. Then end it's turn. Be sure to keep in mind that Deep IQ plays as well as you do (i.e. you have to make some decisions for it); the rule is, if you would attack or block if you were in its position, then it would. If there's more than one choice on one of Deep IQ's rolls, make the decision as though you were in its shoes. Yeah, you can cheat if you want, but cheating to beat a die and a piece of paper is about as gratifying as kissing your sister.

The table roughly corresponds to the amount of mana Deep IQ has available. It's first roll will always be on Table 1. Every time you roll for Deep IQ, check the Advancement range. If the roll falls within the range, move Deep IQ up one table (use a token to keep track). When you cast a spell like Armageddon or Jokulhaups, Deep IQ will move back to Table 1. When you destroy one of its lands (with a spell like Stone Rain), move it back one table.

Whenever Deep IQ gets a creature token, roll again on the token chart to determine the creature's abilities. Apply the number in brackets as a modifier to the roll. (Same thing goes for the Spooky Chart.) If Deep IQ's action is something you can't do, treat the result as "Do nothing."

There will be times when there's no clear-cut rule for how you should handle something (like a Winter Orb or Stasis). Is such cases, come up with an appropriate penalty (such as -5 to all Table die rolls) which lasts until Deep IQ can get rid of your offending artifact or enchantment.

Finally, keep in mind that beating Deep IQ isn't a walk in the park. If you can win even half of your games, that's an accomplishment.
